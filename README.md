### Hi there 👋
- 🔥 I have a passion for game development, mathematics, and overall development.
- 🌱 I'm currently exploring programming architectures and deepening my knowledge in mathematics.
- 🔭 I work as a Flutter developer.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I began learning programming with Unity at the age of 12. Nowadays, I've moved on from that engine and have a preference for game frameworks.
- ♟️ Also, I like to play piano and strategic games like Factorio 
- 🚪 I want to escape from the infernal evil

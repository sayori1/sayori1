ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a mobile developer.

### My Tech Stack:
ðŸ“± **Android**: Kotlin/Java, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMP), RxJava, Dagger 2  
ðŸ“± **Flutter**: BloC, Riverpod, Hive, Freezed

ðŸ’¡ I'm familiar with clean code principles and enjoy a functional approach to programming.

Outside of my main stack, I love exploring new areas, whether itâ€™s gamedev, web, backend, or ML. I also occasionally write in low-level languages.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing a degree in machine learning at a Moscow institute remotely.

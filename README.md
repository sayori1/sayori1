Hi there 👋
-🔥 I have a passion for game development, mathematics, and overall development.
-🌱 I'm currently exploring programming architectures and deepening my knowledge in mathematics.
-🔭 I work as a Flutter developer.
-⚡ Fun fact: I began learning programming with Unity at the age of 12. Nowadays, I've moved on from that engine and have a preference for game frameworks.
